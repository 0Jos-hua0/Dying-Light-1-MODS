# üî´ 1. Weapon Mods Index

Welcome to the armory! This section is all about weapon tweaks, new blueprints, and making melee combat or firearm use feel exactly how you want it to.

We've split the mods into two main categories: **Quality-of-Life Cheats/Tweaks** and **New Content/Blueprints**.

## Quality-of-Life Cheats/Tweaks

These mods are usually simple script changes designed to make the game easier or more convenient by removing grind or frustrating mechanics like low durability.

## New Content/Blueprints

These mods add completely new weapons, custom blueprints, or unique items to the game.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Alert for Older Mods

The **DLC Weapons Overhaul** mod (S.No. QOL 1) was uploaded *very* early in the game's life (2015) and has cheating elements that modify base files.

* **Be Careful:** Mods this old often cause files to completely overwrite official game files, which means they could erase the official "Retouched" improvements.

* **Recommendation:** If you install this, read the Nexus Mods page comments carefully for recent reports, and make sure you back up your files!
