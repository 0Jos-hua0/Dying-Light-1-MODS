# âœ¨ 2. Visual & Graphics Mods Index

Welcome to the section for everything that makes Harran look amazing! These mods focus on textures, lighting, shadows, and overall color grading.

Since most of the mods listed in this index were released or updated recently (within the last few months), they are generally built with the **"Retouched" Update** in mind. Always check the mod author's page for the most specific notes on compatibility!
